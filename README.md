- **Iconset**

  By default channel icons are adapted for **dark backgrounds**, in case your IPTV player have light UI theme you can switch iconset to appropriate with following option **`--icons-for-light-bg`**
  ```
  ustvgo-iptv --icons-for-light-bg
  ```

- **Access logs**

  To enable access logs for tracking requests activity use option **`--access-logs`**
  ```
  ustvgo-iptv --access-logs
  ```

- **Server port**

  By default the port is **6363**. You can change it with option **`--port`**
  ```
  ustvgo-iptv --port 1234
  ```

- **Parallel requests**

  When server starts it initiate collecting stream URLs for master playlist using **10** parallel requests. You can specify number of parallel requests with option **`--parallel`**
  ```

  ```
  
- **Uncompressed TV Guide**

  Some IPTV players can automatically grab TV Gude from m3u8 playlists. For the URL they look at `url-tvg` attribute.
  By default it has link to compressed version of TV Guide: `#EXTM3U url-tvg="http://127.0.0.1:6363/tvguide.xml.gz" refresh="1800"`.
  
  You can change it to uncompressed `"http://127.0.0.1:6363/tvguide.xml"`
  with option **`--use-uncompressed-tvguide`**
  ```
  ustvgo-iptv --use-uncompressed-tvguide

## üîó URLs
To play and enjoy your free IPTV you need 2 URLs:
1) Your generated **master playlist**: üîó http://127.0.0.1:6363/ustvgo.m3u8
2) **TV Guide** (content updates twice an hour): üîó http://127.0.0.1:6363/tvguide.xml

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Players
  Here is a **list** of popular IPTV players.
  
  **USTVGO**'s channels have **EIA-608** embedded subtitles. In case if you're not a native speaker and use *TV*, *Cartoons*, *Movies* and *Shows* to learn English and Spanish languages I would recommend you following free open-source cross-platform IPTV players that can handle EIA-608 subtitles:
  - **[VLC](https://github.com/videolan/vlc)**
  
      This old beast could play **any subtitles**. Unfortunately it **doesn't support TV Guide**.
      
      - **Play**
        ```bash
        vlc http://127.0.0.1:6363/ustvgo.m3u8
        ```
  - **[MPV](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv)**
      
      Fast and extensible player. It **supports subtitles**, but not that good as VLC, sometimes you could encounter troubles playing roll-up subtitles. Unfortunately it **doesn't suppport TV Guide**.
      
      - **Play**
        ```bash
        mpv http://127.0.0.1:6363/ustvgo.m3u8
        ```
  - **[Jellyfin Media Player](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-media-player)**
    
    <img alt="Jellyfin Media Player screenshot" width="49%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20641837/173175969-cbfe5adc-1dc8-4e3b-946c-fa4e295d8b8c.jpg"/>
    <img alt="Jellyfin Media Player screenshot" width="49%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20641837/173175973-8acb076c-e1ac-4d06-96a8-b10a72b2f7d7.jpg"/>

    Comfortable, handy, extensible with smooth UI player. **Supports TV Guide**, has **mpv** as a backend.
    
    **Supports subtitles**, but there is no option to enable them via user interface. If you want to enable IPTV subtitles you have to use following "Mute" hack.
  
    - **Enable IPTV subtitles**
    
      I found a quick hack to force play embedded IPTV subtitles, all you need is to create one file:
    
      > Linux: `~/.local/share/jellyfinmediaplayer/scripts/subtitles.lua`
    
      > Linux(Flatpak): `~/.var/app/com.github.iwalton3.jellyfin-media-player/data/jellyfinmediaplayer/scripts/subtitles.lua`
    
      > MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Jellyfin Media Player/scripts/subtitles.lua`
    
      > Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\JellyfinMediaPlayer\scripts\subtitles.lua`
    
      And paste following text in there:
    
      ```lua
      -- File: subtitles.lua
      function on_mute_change(name, value)
          if value then
              local subs_id = mp.get_property("sid")
              if subs_id == "1" then
                  mp.osd_message("Subtitles off")
                  mp.set_property("sid", "0")
              else
                  mp.osd_message("Subtitles on")
                  mp.set_property("sid", "1")
              end
          end
      end

      mp.observe_property("mute", "bool", on_mute_change)
      ```
      After that every time you mute a video *(üÖº key pressed)*, you toggle subtitles on/off as a side effect.
      
    - **Play**
      ```
      1) Settings -> Dashboard -> Live TV -> Tuner Devices -> Add -> M3U Tuner -> URL -> http://127.0.0.1:6363/ustvgo.m3u8

      ```
